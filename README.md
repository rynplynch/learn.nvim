# Ryan's neovim Plugin
## Why I Made this Repository

* learn Lua
* better understand functional languages at large
* write my own software!

## My Aim

I want to write my very own neovim plugin in Lua! Here are some goals/objectives:
- [ ] pratice TDD
- [ ] print 'hello world' after loading the plugin
- [ ] export my plugin as a nix flake output
- [ ] consume my plugin in my neovim configuration [found here](https://github.com/rynplynch/my-nixCats)
